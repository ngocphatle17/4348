The reason why I have 20 commits is because I did not commit during my implementing phases, which I was struggling the most, I know it is a bad habit and may lose my points for this projects, but I tried to commit and work through the project again. At first, I had 3 different txt files to contain the tests and outputs, but in my final submission, I have combined into one devlog file.
